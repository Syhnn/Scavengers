# Scavengers - Unity tutorial

Scavengers is a simple 2D Roguelike game.
The cool thing here is that you have a few assets to work with : animated sprites, sfxand music...

*This project was created using the official unity3d tutorial. You can find the original project [here](http://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/projects/2d-roguelike-tutorial).*

## What do I plan to do here

When I'll have a bit of time, I'll try to add some cool stuff into the game to make it more interesting and less linear.
The first few things I'm thinking about are :

* Items like gears or weapons
* More diversity to levels
* More complex scoring
